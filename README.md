# iAssist

Feature additions to Softline Pastel (2005). 

## Installation

Upload the app directory to somewhere, import the **dump.sql** into MySQL and edit the *app/config/var.php* file.

## Notes

iAssist was originally built (long ago) to integrate into legacy Pastel systems under very specific environments. It unfortunately only saw a little bit of game time, but please feel to experiment with it. The code is also fairly undocumented, so any real world use might be minimal.
